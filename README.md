Fake News Detector

This repository contains the code for a web application that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect fake news articles.

Project Structure:

Model/:
This folder houses the trained NLP model used for fake news classification. The specific model file name and type may vary depending on your chosen approach (e.g., model.h5 for TensorFlow, model.pkl for scikit-learn).
static/:
This folder stores all static assets used by the web application, including:
background.jpg (or other image format): The background image for your app's interface.
style.css: Stylesheet defining the visual appearance of the application.
script.js: JavaScript code responsible for user interaction and functionality.
templates/:
This folder contains the HTML template for your web application:
index.html: The main HTML page that defines the structure and layout of your app. It incorporates elements like input fields, a submit button, and a display area for classification results.
fake_news_data.csv: This CSV file stores your dataset of labeled news articles used for training the NLP model. The dataset should have columns for the news text itself and a label indicating whether it's real or fake.
app.py: This Python file contains the core logic of your web application. It performs these key tasks:
Loads the trained NLP model from the Model folder.
Defines routes to handle user requests (typically using a web framework like Flask or Django).
Processes user-submitted text using NLP techniques (e.g., text preprocessing, feature extraction).
Makes predictions using the loaded model to classify the text as real or fake news.
Renders the index.html template, potentially with the classification result displayed.
train_model.py: This optional Python script serves the purpose of training the NLP model from scratch. It usually involves these steps:
Reads the fake_news_data.csv file to load the training data.
Preprocesses the text data (e.g., cleaning, tokenization, vectorization).
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Defines and trains the NLP model on the training set using libraries like TensorFlow, scikit-learn, or spaCy.
Evaluates the model's performance on the testing set.
Optionally, saves the trained model to the Model folder.
Instructions

Prerequisites:
Install the necessary Python libraries using pip install <library_name>. This will likely include requirements like pandas, NumPy, and your chosen NLP library (e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn).
A web framework like Flask or Django is recommended for building the web application (if not already installed, use pip install Flask or pip install Django).
Training the Model (optional):
If you haven't already trained the model, run the train_model.py script. This script will create (and possibly overwrite) the model file in the Model folder.
Running the App:
Depending on your web framework, follow the instructions to run the application server. This typically involves starting the development server by running a command like flask run or python manage.py runserver.
Access the App:
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:<port> where <port> is the port specified by your web framework (usually 5000 by default). This should load your fake news detection app.
Additional Notes:

This README.md provides a comprehensive overview of your fake news detection app's functionality, structure, and setup. Feel free to adjust it as needed to align with your specific implementation details and web framework.
